      The controversy surrounding the “Light Brown Apple Moth” (LBAM) is outlined in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Brown_Apple_Moth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 underline">Wikipedia article</a>. In short, the U.S. EPA and the California Department of Food and Agriculture believed that LBAM posed a serious threat to crops in California. In response, they authorized aerial spraying of a so-called “non-toxic” pesticide, which was carried out twice in late 2007 over populated areas of Monterey County. I co-authored a paper with Dr. Dennis Knepp demonstrating that the fine particle size of the spray presented a public health hazard. Ultimately, the CDFA lost multiple lawsuits and abandoned the spraying program. To date, no significant crop damage has been attributed to LBAM. A PDF version of our analysis, including related correspondence and attachments, is archived <a href="/KneppHafermanLetterAndAttachments.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 underline">here</a>.
