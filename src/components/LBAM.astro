      The “Light Brown Apple Moth” (LBAM) controversy is outlined in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Brown_Apple_Moth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 underline">Wikipedia article</a>. The U.S. EPA and California Department of Food and Agriculture believed LBAM posed a serious threat to crops and authorized aerial spraying of a so-called “non-toxic” pesticide, which was carried out twice in 2007 over populated areas of Monterey County. I co-authored a paper with Dr. Dennis Knepp showing that the fine particles in the spray posed a health hazard. The CDFA lost several lawsuits and ultimately abandoned the program. To date, no significant crop damage has been linked to LBAM. A PDF of our analysis and related correspondence is archived <a href="/KneppHafermanLetterAndAttachments.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 underline">here</a>.
