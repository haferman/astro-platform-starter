    <p>
      The “Light Brown Apple Moth” (LBAM) controversy is described in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Brown_Apple_Moth" class="text-blue-600 underline">Wikipedia article</a>.
      My short (and perhaps biased) account: the U.S. EPA and California Department of Food and Agriculture believed the LBAM would infest California and destroy crops.
      Aerial spraying of a supposedly “non‑toxic” pesticide was authorized, and two sprayings took place in late 2007 over populated areas in Monterey County.

      I co‑wrote a paper with Dr. Dennis Knepp showing that the number of small particles in the spray was a health hazard.
      The CDFA lost a couple of lawsuits and abandoned the program, and to date, there has been no significant crop damage from the LBAM.
      A PDF version of our analysis (and related correspondence) is archived <a href="/LBAM-analysis.pdf" class="text-blue-600 underline">here</a>.
