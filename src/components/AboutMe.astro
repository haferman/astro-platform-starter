    <p>
      I’m a computational and data scientist with over two decades of experience spanning supercomputing, high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, and complex systems. My work blends hands-on technical expertise with strategic leadership, from building research infrastructure and leading HPC teams to deploying cutting-edge AI and blockchain systems.

    <p>
      Since 2006, I’ve directed HPC and Research Computing initiatives, overseeing everything from Linux clusters and engineering workflows to network operations and data center design. More recently, my focus has included accelerated computing with GPUs, infrastructure automation, and blockchain-based platforms — including real-world deployments on networks like Ethereum, NEAR, and Celo.

      I hold a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Chicago and earned both my M.S. and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Iowa. Along the way, I was honored to serve as a NASA Global Change Fellow and conducted postdoctoral research at NASA Goddard.

      Outside of formal roles, I’ve contributed to mathematical curiosities like the <em>Haferman Carpet</em>, co-authored environmental analyses, and published scientific research in multiple domains. Below, you’ll find a few highlights from my work — academic, technical, and occasionally offbeat. Feel free to browse, or reach out if something sparks your interest.
