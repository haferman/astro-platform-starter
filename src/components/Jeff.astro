        This is the “Haferman Carpet” by Jeff Haferman. It is a fractal I put together as part of a homework problem when I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, probably around 1984. There is a nice description of this fractal at <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HafermanCarpet.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">Wolfram Mathworld</a>. My professor at the time was Jeffrey Shallit. A colorized version of the carpet appears on the cover of the book <em>Automatic Sequences</em> by Allouche and Shallit. For the very mathematically inclined, there is an entry on the Haferman Carpet in <a href="https://oeis.org" class="text-blue-600 underline">The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.

        My Erdös Number is 4 (I co-authored a paper with Benjamin Kedem, who co-authored with Eric V. Slud, who co-authored with Robert W. Chen, who co-authored with Paul Erdös). I do not yet have an Erdös–Bacon number. My <a href="https://scholar.google.com" class="text-blue-600 underline">Google Scholar</a> citations page lists most of my academic writings. <a href="/CV.pdf" class="text-blue-600 underline">Here is a link to my CV.</a>
