  <h2>About Jeff Haferman</h2>

    <h3>Haferman Carpet</h3>
    <p>This is the “Haferman Carpet” by Jeff Haferman. It is a fractal I put together as part of a homework problem when I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, probably around 1984. There is a nice description of this fractal at Wolfram Mathworld. My professor at the time was Jeffrey Shallit. A colorized version of the carpet appears on the cover of the book <em>Automatic Sequences</em> by Allouche and Shallit. For the very mathematically inclined, there is an entry on the Haferman Carpet in <em>The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</em>.</p>

    <h3>Erdös Number</h3>
    <p>My Erdös Number is 4 (I co-authored a paper with Benjamin Kedem, who co-authored with Eric V. Slud, who co-authored with Robert W. Chen, who co-authored with Paul Erdös). I do not yet have an Erdös–Bacon number. My <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> citations page lists most of my academic writings. <a href="/CV.pdf">Here is a link to my CV.</a></p>

    <h3>Light Brown Apple Moth (LBAM)</h3>
    <p>The “Light Brown Apple Moth” (LBAM) controversy is described in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Brown_Apple_Moth">Wikipedia article</a>. My short (and perhaps biased) account: the U.S. EPA and California Department of Food and Agriculture believed the LBAM would infest California and destroy crops. Aerial spraying of a supposedly “non‑toxic” pesticide was authorized, and two sprayings took place in late 2007 over populated areas in Monterey County. I co‑wrote a paper with Dr. Dennis Knepp showing that the number of small particles in the spray was a health hazard. The CDFA lost a couple of lawsuits and abandoned the program, and, to date, there has been no significant crop damage from the LBAM. A PDF of our analysis (and related correspondence) is archived <a href="/LBAM-analysis.pdf">here</a>.</p>
