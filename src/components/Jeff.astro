      <p>
        This is the “Haferman Carpet” by Jeff Haferman. It is a fractal I put together as part of a homework problem when I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, probably around 1984.
        There is a nice description of this fractal at <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HafermanCarpet.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">Wolfram Mathworld</a>.
        My professor at the time was Jeffrey Shallit.
        A colorized version of the carpet appears on the cover of the book <em>Automatic Sequences</em> by Allouche and Shallit.
        For the very mathematically inclined, there is an entry on the Haferman Carpet in the <a href="https://oeis.org" class="text-blue-600 underline">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.

        My Erdös Number is 4 (I co-authored a paper with Benjamin Kedem, who co-authored with Eric V. Slud, who co-authored with Robert W. Chen, who co-authored with Paul Erdös).
        I do not yet have an Erdös–Bacon number.

        The “Light Brown Apple Moth” (LBAM) controversy is described in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Brown_Apple_Moth" class="text-blue-600 underline">Wikipedia article</a>.
        My short (and perhaps biased) account: the U.S. EPA and California Department of Food and Agriculture believed the LBAM would infest California and destroy crops.
        Aerial spraying of a supposedly “non‑toxic” pesticide was authorized, and two sprayings took place in late 2007 over populated areas in Monterey County.
      </p>
      <p>
        I co‑wrote a paper with Dr. Dennis Knepp showing that the number of small particles in the spray was a health hazard.
        The CDFA lost a couple of lawsuits and abandoned the program, and to date, there has been no significant crop damage from the LBAM.
        A PDF version of our analysis (and related correspondence) is archived <a href="/LBAM-analysis.pdf" class="text-blue-600 underline">here</a>.
