    <p>
      I created the “Haferman Carpet” as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, likely around 1984. It’s a self-similar fractal that emerged from a homework assignment under the guidance of Professor Jeffrey Shallit.

      Since then, the fractal has gained attention. For instance, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HafermanCarpet.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">Wolfram MathWorld</a> provides a clear description of its structure and mathematical significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A colorized version even appears on the cover of <em>Automatic Sequences</em> by Allouche and Shallit. Moreover, the <a href="https://oeis.org" class="text-blue-600 underline">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)</a> includes a reference to the Haferman Carpet for those with a strong interest in its number-theoretic properties.
