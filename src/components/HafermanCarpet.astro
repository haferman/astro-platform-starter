    <p>
      This is the “Haferman Carpet” by Jeff Haferman. It is a fractal I put together as part of a homework problem when I was an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, probably around 1984.
      There is a nice description of this fractal at <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HafermanCarpet.html" class="text-blue-600 underline">Wolfram Mathworld</a>.
      My professor at the time was Jeffrey Shallit.
      A colorized version of the carpet appears on the cover of the book <em>Automatic Sequences</em> by Allouche and Shallit.
      For the very mathematically inclined, there is an entry on the Haferman Carpet in the <a href="https://oeis.org" class="text-blue-600 underline">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.
