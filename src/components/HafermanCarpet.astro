    <p>
      I created the “Haferman Carpet” as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, likely around 1984, while working on a homework assignment under the guidance of Professor Jeffrey Shallit. It’s a self-similar fractal that has since gained attention in the mathematical community. For instance, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HafermanCarpet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 underline">Wolfram MathWorld</a> provides a detailed description of its recursive structure. A colorized version of the carpet appears on the cover of the book <em>Automatic Sequences</em> by Allouche and Shallit. Moreover, for those deeply interested in mathematical sequences, the <a href="https://oeis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 underline">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> includes a reference to the Haferman Carpet and its numeric properties.
